1. Once npm finished installing and you have downloaded the client on your phone, run the `expo start` command. This will start up the app and it should boot up in your web browser. Use your camera/QR code scanner to scan the QR code and open the app on your mobile device. 
***If you get an error when trying to open on your phone about "unable to resolve @expo/vector-icons" let me know***
2. In your favorite IDE, you can start making changes to the app. The best place to start is `AnxietyApp/screens/HomeScreen.js`
3. Save the file and watch the screen update in real time!
